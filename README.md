# fling âŒ†

fling (and retrieve) your daily logs with Farcaster

## inspiration

* John Carmack's .plan files
* ohlife.com - "how did you day go?" email startup

## features

* each day you can fling only single root cast
* any additional flings in a given day are added as sibling replies to that root cast
* when you invoke without any message, it shows you random day, or the current days so far  `fling` -> should give you something like 

"Oh snap, remember this? X days ago you flung:"

"foo bar baz cool stuff"


## todo

* [x] fix date checker
* [ ] add error handling (char length)
* [ ] show previous day
